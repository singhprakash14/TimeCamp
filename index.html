                <div class="div14">
                    <p>A time tracker is computer software or a web app that allows teams, managers, and freelancers to measure time spent on tasks and projects. It is used in many industries (law firms, accounting, creative agencies, IT teams) for settling up with hourly workers and billing clients for work.</p>
                    <p>You can integrate a time tracker with third-party tools for project management, accounting, customer service, to-do lists, and many more.</p>
                    <p>Speaking shortly, a time tracker helps you understand which practices in your business lead to time waste. With this knowledge, you can reduce bad practices and optimize workflow.</p>

                <div class="div14">
                    <p>There are many reasons to use time tracking software. Here are the main use cases for a time tracker:</p>
                    <p>1. <strong>Tracking billable hours: </strong>helps freelancers and employees who are paid on an hourly basis measure time spent on work with accuracy up to every second.</p>
                    <p>2. <strong>Improving productivity: </strong>employees who struggle with poor time management and distractions can work on their efficiency, understand how they work, and what takes most of their time.</p>
                    <p>3. <strong>Timesheet management: </strong>one of the most common features of time tracker is a timesheet – a digital version of a paper timesheet. With a time tracker, your team can have it filled out automatically.</p>
                    <p>4. <strong>Work automation: </strong>time tracker helps to save time on administrative and repetitive tasks, better allocate resources, cut costs, and smoothen teams’ workflow.</p>
